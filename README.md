## üî• Overview
We are thrilled to introduce **RoboBrain-X0**, a groundbreaking cross-ontology foundation model designed to overcome the limitations of single-robot systems in heterogeneous ontology transfer. By leveraging End-Effector pose representation in SE(3) task space, coupled with a Unified Action Vocabulary (UAV) and action tokenizer, RoboBrain-X0 achieves efficient zero-shot generalization and complex task decomposition. Its Grouped Residual Quantizer (GRVQ) maps continuous control sequences from diverse degrees of freedom and mechanical structures to a shared discrete action primitive space, ensuring semantic consistency and transferability across ontologies such as **AgileX**, **R1-Lite dual-arm wheeled robots**, and **Franka single-arm systems**. Through ontology-conditioned diverse prompting, the model supports flexible decoding from multi-view RGB-D inputs to specific executions, significantly reducing training and inference overhead. RoboBrain-X0 delivers state-of-the-art performance in embodied reasoning tasks, laying a robust foundation for developing versatile, real-world robotic agents and advancing embodied intelligence research.

## üóûÔ∏è News
- **`2025-09-29`**: üî• [**RoboBrain-X0-preview**](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/RoboBrain-X0-Preview) was released.


## üìÜ Todo
- [x] Release model checkpoint for RoboBrain-X0-Preview
- [ ] Release quick inference example for RoboBrain-X0
- [ ] Release training and evaluation codes for RoboBrain-X0


## üöÄ Features
**RoboBrain-X0** supports the unified modeling of heterogeneous ontologies and offers zero-shot generalization and complex task decomposition capabilities. Building on RoboBrain's multimodal foundation, RoboBrain-X0 further integrates real-world robot motion data based on RoboBrain-2.0 data. By unifying vision, language, and motion modeling, it achieves cross-ontology generalization and adaptation, providing integrated capabilities from perception to execution.


## ‚≠êÔ∏è Architecture
This model includes **RoboBrain 2.0** and **OmniSAT** (action tokenizer). Based on RoboBrain 2.0, the model is trained on a large amount of real-world robotics data and embodied reasoning data, enabling it to possess general robotic manipulation capabilities. The action token sequences output by the model are converted into underlying robot control signals through our proprietary action tokenizer. Model details are as follows:
- **Multimodal Input**: The model accepts single-image, multi-image, and text input (covering pointing task scenarios, object maneuverability scenarios, trajectory scenarios, and subtask execution scenarios), and produces outputs of varying dimensions based on the input scenarios.
- **Action Generation and Execution**: After model processing, OmniSAT converts these into multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) action sequences, ultimately driving the robot to complete the operation.
